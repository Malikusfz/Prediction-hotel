## Technical Architecture 🏗️

### Classification Models

#### 1. Random Forest Classifier
- Ensemble learning with multiple decision trees
- Feature importance analysis
- Robust against overfitting
- Excellent for handling non-linear relationships

#### 2. Logistic Regression
- Probabilistic classification approach
- Linear decision boundary optimization
- High interpretability
- Efficient for large datasets

#### 3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Kernel-based classification
- Optimal hyperplane calculation
- Effective in high-dimensional spaces
- Strong theoretical guarantees

## Installation 🚀

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hotel-booking-classification.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd hotel-booking-classification

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset Description 📋

The Hotel Bookings dataset includes various features:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Lead Time | Days between booking and arrival |
| Arrival Date | Check-in date |
| Stay Duration | Length of stay |
| Guest Type | Type of booking guest |
| Booking Channel | Booking platform/method |

## Usage 💻

```python
# Example usage of the classification model
from hotel_booking import HotelBookingClassifier

# Initialize classifier
classifier = HotelBookingClassifier()

# Train model
classifier.train(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = classifier.predict(X_test)
```
